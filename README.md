# Image_captioning
description of images
Designed an image captioning model based on the encoder-decoder architecture using pre-trained VGG16 aencoder for image feature extraction and a feed forward neural network with LSTM layers as the decoder Conducted necessary text preprocessing and tokenization of the input data, for feeding into the decoder model Completed pre-processing of image data, preparing it for feature extraction by feeding it into the encoder Assessed the model’s performance by using standard metrics like BLEU-1 and BLEU-2, the model achieved0.54 and 0.36 BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 scores respectively indicating it’s capability in capturing uni and bi-grams Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k
